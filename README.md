# React Google Books Search

Book search and save application using Google Books and built with React.

## Technologies Used

Express
Mongo/Mongoose
Javascript ES6
ReactJS
Material-UI
Axios
Google Books API
HTML5

## Features

Users can search for books by typing a search query in the search bar. The application pulls data from the Google books API to populate 10 results to the page. Each result has a title, author(s), image, description, and the option to view the returned google books data or save the book. If a book is saved, it will be added to the mongo database and will be visible on the saved page. On the saved page, all saved books populate with the same data as on the search page, but with the option to delete them from the saved list.
